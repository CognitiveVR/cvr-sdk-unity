Ready Room
=========
This sample contains a scene and several prefabs for onboarding your users into a virtual environment. This may include familiarizing your users with common inputs in your project and ensuring that hardware is configured correctly.

Generally, you do not need to upload this scene to our dashboard. The behaviour from users here may be unusual as they are acclimatizing themselves to a virtual space.

There is a list of Assessment game objects that will be displayed to your users. These are intended to be expanded for your particular use case.
