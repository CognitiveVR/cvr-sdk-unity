Exitpoll Customization
=========
This sample contains duplicate prefabs of the Exitpoll Panels included in the Cognitive3D package. By importing this sample into your project, you are able to easily change these prefabs for your own branding and style.

To use these customized prefabs, drag the ExitPollHolderPrefab into your scene - it is already configured to use these prefabs instead of the defaults.
